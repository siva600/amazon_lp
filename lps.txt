# Amazon's Leadership Principles Worksheet

## STAR Method Framework

### Point A: Story Telling
**POINT A:** Story telling… this is where you set-the-stage. Put the 
interviewer in your shoes so they want to follow along for the rest of 
the story.

**HOOK THEM!**

### Getting From Point A to Point B
**GETTING FROM POINT A TO POINT B:** Now, let's give them the details. 
What happened? What did **YOU** do? How did you address the 
problem/task/challenge at-hand?

**Details & DATA!**

### Point B: Conclusion
**POINT B:** Wrap it up, and put a pretty bow on it! Every good story 
has a satisfying ending. "The End" isn't going to cut it.

**Bring it "full circle"!**

## STAR Method Breakdown

### STAR Method:
Don't play all your cards. Leave room for follow-up questions

- **Situation / Task (set the stage)** - *1-2 minutes*
- **Actions (give the details; what did YOU do to address it?)** - 
  *5-6 minutes*
- **Results (wrap it up; conclusion)** - *1-2 minutes*
- **Extra details, stats, etc.** - *2-3 minutes if time allows*

### Detailed STAR Guidelines

**SITUATION:** Describe the situation that you were in, or the task that 
you needed to accomplish. Give enough detail for the interviewer to 
understand the complexities of the situation. This example can be from a 
previous job, school project, volunteer activity, or any relevant event.

**TASK:** What goal were you working toward?

**ACTION:** Describe the actions you took to address the situation with 
an appropriate amount of detail, and keep the focus on you. What specific 
steps did you take? What was your particular contribution? Be careful 
that you don't describe what the team or group did when talking about a 
project.

Let us know what **YOU** actually did. Use the word "I," not "we," when 
describing actions.

**RESULT:** Describe the outcome of your actions and don't be shy about 
taking credit for your behavior. What happened? How did the event end? 
What did you accomplish? What did you learn?

Provide examples using metrics or data if applicable.

## Leadership Principles

**GREEN = higher probability for interviews**

## 1. Customer Obsession

### Definition
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously 
to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to 
competitors, they obsess over customers.

### Sample Questions
1. Describe a difficult interaction you had with a customer. How did you 
   deal with it? What was the outcome? How would you handle it 
   differently?

2. Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond for a customer. 
   Why did you do it? How did the customer respond? What was the outcome?

3. Give me an example of when you were able to anticipate a customer need 
   with a solution/product they didn't know they needed/wanted yet. How 
   did you know they needed this? How did they respond? 
   (pro active with the customer)

### Self-Assessment Questions
Do you…
- Honestly pursue customer feedback, not just solicit for compliments?
- Ask, "is what I'm working on helping my customer"?
- Listen for what your customer wants, before/instead of telling them 
  what they need (internal customers)?
- Avoid assuming you know more about them than they do?
- Involve all stakeholders who serve your customers, and make sure your 
  activities fit with their activities and work together for the customer?
- Remove non-value steps?
- Stop activities as soon as you realize they no longer enhance the 
  customer experience?
- Think of the customer as a "friend" and tailor your work in that manner?
- Assume the position of the customer (i.e., how would you like to be 
  treated)?

### Example Stories

#### Story 1: Pipeline Process Improvement
**SITUATION:** A user was frustrated because their pull request (PR) was 
repeatedly blocked by failures in multiple pipeline stages, preventing 
merge. According to our SDLC process, every PR had to pass a comprehensive 
set of automated checks. However, the user felt the process was overly 
strict and slow, especially for small, low-risk changes.

**TASK:** My goal was to balance high quality and compliance standards 
while reducing friction in the developer workflow to improve their 
experience and productivity.

**ACTION:** I proactively engaged users relevant stakeholders to understand 
the pain points and gather feedback. I conducted thorough review of pipeline 
and some checks were unnecessary applied across all PR's, regardless of the 
scope. 

I partnered with platform team and to design a solution that automatically 
categorizes PR's by nature and size, this allowed us to run targeted subset 
of validations on small or low impact PR's. I worked with Risk Control 
management team and came up with a process to assign a risk assessment score 
and we the risk score is divided into bands. the changes fall into lower 
bands are skipped for next steps. 

Additionally I have improved the error responses which made developers 
seamlessly identify the cause of failures within each stage.

**RESULT:** This new approach reduced pipeline de
